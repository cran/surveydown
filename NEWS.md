# surveydown (development version)

# surveydown 0.5.1

- Revert mostly to v0.4.2 to completely remove the cookies feature added in v0.5.0. Will re-implement a new approach in a later version.
- Fixed typo in error message (`data.csv` -> `preview_data.csv`).

# surveydown 0.5.0

- New cookies feature! Now `sd_server()` accepts a new argument `use_cookies`, defaults to `TRUE`. It enables cookies so that reopening the survey will resume the participant to where the survey was left. The database will trace to the original `session_id` and continuous the data update based on user input. If changed to `FALSE`, the survey will start as brand new session upon reopening.
- Off-line data storage upgrade. Now if ignore mode is on, the data will be stored on the project directory with file name called `preview_data.csv`. This file works exactly the same as online database, and is compatible with cookies functionality.
- Simplified Chinese supported in `sd_server()`. You can trigger it by: `sd_server(language = "zh-CN")`.
- Improvement: default language behavior in UI functions cleaner when separately rendering survey.qmd file.
- Bug fix: There used to be a bug if multiple themes are defined in YAML. Now it's solved.

# surveydown 0.4.2

- New "translations" feature now supported (see PR #138). This allows system messages and date formats to be specified by a language using the `language` argument in `sd_server()`. Custom language messages can be further modified by providing a `translations.yml` file in the root project folder.
- Added new `sd_create_translations()` function to generate a template `translations.yml` file to use to edit the system messages.
- Added Stefan Munnes as contributor in DESCRIPTION file (`ctb`)
- Bug fix: The `is_matrix` metadata was not recorded for matrix sub-questions when exported into the `_survey/questions.yml` file, which caused an error if any matrix question was required. This is now corrected when obtaining the question structure from the stored `_survey/questions.yml` file.

# surveydown 0.4.1

- Modified survey rendering to move all rendered files into "_survey" folder.
- Export survey question metadata to "_survey/questions.yml" file (see #132).
- Survey content is now extracted and saved to '_survey/pages.rds', '_survey/head.rds', and '_survey/questions.yml' files for faster loading.
- Survey will load content from stored files if no changes detected in 'survey.qmd' or 'app.R' files.

# surveydown 0.4.0

- All examples updated to include run-able examples (where possible).
- Added example survey.qmd files in inst/examples (for use in function examples).
- All roxygen documentation reviewed for errors / typos.
- Removed `sd_update()` function.
- Removed `sd_deploy()` function.
- Installation instructions updated.

# surveydown 0.3.7

- Updated `sd_output()` to now be able to output the chosen question values, chosen question option label(s), and the question label itself. Addresses feature request #128.
- Enhance: `sd_update()` now directly force update the package without checking for version difference anymore.
- New: `sd_is_answered()` function to check if a question is answered or not and returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` accordingly. For `"matrix"` type, only if all sub-questions are answered will it be marked as `TRUE`.

# surveydown 0.3.6

- Enhance: `sd_add_question()` now has a `chunk` argument, if `TRUE` it will include the outer chunk wrapper. Default is `FALSE`.
- Enhance: The `matrix` question type now will have its root question id shown in the data sheet. This id is essential in other logic, for example it can be used as a handle for the `sd_show_if()` logic. This root id is also removed from the `all_question_required` logic, since it's only a handle and doesn't provide option to answer.
- Enhance: Removed the `use_html` argument in `sd_server()`. Now the survey.qmd file will always be rendered when the app runs only if one of two conditions are met: 1) the survey.html file is not detected, or 2) the survey.html file is outdated. Otherwise, it will use the rendered survey.html file.
- Bug fix: `auto_scroll` now works better and smoother.
- Bug fix: the enter key will not trigger page turn if working on `text`, `textarea`, `numeric`, `select`, `date`, and `daterange`.
- Enhance: the Enter key can now used to trigger the "Submit and Exit" button for the rating pop-up modal.

# surveydown 0.3.5

- Enhance: The database updating is simplified to only write to the database on each page turn and after the survey closes.
- Bug fix: if you added new questions or values to the survey after creating the initial database table, those new values would not have been added to the table. Now they are added.
- Enhance: `auto_scroll` changed to `FALSE` by default.

# surveydown 0.3.4

- Bug fix: reactive questions now work with show_if conditions too
- Bug fix: show_if conditions now work even if the target question is on a different page.
- Bug fix: reactive question ids (those defined in the server) were not being considered in `check_skip_show()` checks, so you'd get an error that the question id was invalid.
- Enhance: `sd_server()` accepts a new parameter called `"rate_survey"`, default to `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, the Exit button will trigger a rating question. If `FALSE`, the Exit button will only trigger a double confirmation to ensure the user really wants to exit.
- Enhance: Now the survey will check if there exists an `sd_close()` function call.
- Enhance: Now the survey will check if the reserved question IDs are used, including `session_id`, `time_start`, `time_end`, and `exit_survey_rating`. There could be more in the future.
- Enhance: Now the `sd_output()` function will take care of the styling setting of reactive questions. For example, `sd_output(id = "some_question_id", type = "question", width = "80%")` will define with of 80% for a reactive question.
- Enhance: Now the `sd_show_if()` can take care of cross-page conditional reactive questions.

# surveydown 0.3.3

- Enhance: `sd_server()` now has a new parameter called `auto_scroll`. It's default to `TRUE`, which enables auto scrolling that tracks the user's input, can be turned off by changing to `FALSE`. Thanks to the contribution from [Zain Hoda](https://github.com/zainhoda1).
- Enhance: `sd_question()` now has the `"matrix"` type. The [documentation page](https://surveydown.org/question-types#matrix) is updated.
- Enhance: Asterisk, as an indication of required questions, is now moved to the top right corner of question containers.
- Enhance: Replaced the default shiny alert with `sweetalert`. 

# surveydown 0.3.2

- New: Added `sd_completion_code()` function.
- Bug fix: make stored values accessible with `sd_output()` with `type = 'value'` argument. Previously only question values could be displayed in the UI with `sd_output()`.
- New: `sd_add_question()` to instantly create a question template. Defaults to type of `"mc"` but also accepts all other types (`"text"`, `"textarea"`, `"numeric"`, etc.). The function call will delete itself after running.
- New: `sd_add_page()` to instantly create a page template. Make sure to run this function outside any division or code chunk. The function call will delete itself after running.

# surveydown 0.3.1

- Enhance: Improved efficiency in `database_uploading()` so only the changed fields get written, and also the writing happens after checking the `show_if` conditions (addresses #100).
- Enhance: Modified default rendering behavior to not delete the rendered html file.
- Enhance: Modified the `refresh_interval` argument in `sd_get_data()` as defaulting to `NULL`, which means the data will not be reactively fetched, regardless of the context it is used in. The data will only continuously refresh if `sd_get_data()` is called within a reactive context and `refresh_interval > 0`.
- Enhance: Modified messaging from `sd_set_password()` to not print out user's password and provide clearer instructions.
- New: `sd_show_password()` added to show a stored password. The user will be prompted to double confirm that they want to show it. If there is no password, the user will be prompted so, along with a message of using `sd_set_password()` to create the password.

# surveydown 0.3.0

- Introduced `sd_ui()` function to set placeholders for the shiny app ui.
- Heavily revised how `skip_if` and `show_if` works, removing `skip_if_custom` and `show_if_custom`. Now they work similar to the `case_when()` function, where you provide the formula `condition ~ target` for each condition in either function. These are also provided globally inside the `server()` function using `sd_skip_if()` and `sd_show_if()`.
- Require that the survey file be named `"survey.qmd"`.
- Added `sd_include_folder()` function so users can add a folder to the shiny resource path.
- Automatically include the `images`, `js`, `css`, and `www` folders as well as folders to quarto files to the shiny resource path when the package loads.
- Heavily modified how `sd_next()` works to improve page navigation and ensure that each `sd_next()` button has a unique id based on the current page.
- Removed the quarto extension.
- `sd_create_survey()` changed to sourcing template directly from the package. Two parameters are provided. The first parameter is `path`, which defines the relative path of the target. If left blank, the path will be the current working directory. The second parameter is `structure`, which defines which structure of the template the user wants to choose, default as `"single"` and can be changed to `"multi"`.
- `sd_deploy()` as a wrapper function of `rsconnect::deployApp()` to deploy the survey.
- `sd_update()` as a replacement of `sd_update_surveydown()` to update the package.
- `sd_version()` as a replacement of `sd_check_versions()` to check for the current version and the latest version.
- `sd_close()` function to create a close button for the survey.

# surveydown 0.2.4

- No need to use `<br>` above the Next button anymore. The Next buttons can now be in the same chunk as the questions as spacing has been added.
- Modified margins on top and bottom. Solved the large gap created by hidden questions.
- Fixed an issue with `sd_store_value()`. There used to be a problem if a value is a list with multiple entries. Now they are collapsed with commas due to the application of `format_question_value()` on the `value` variable.
- Removed the `reactive` argument for `sd_get_data()`. Now all functions that should be compatible with both reactive (server) and static (ui) conditions will automatically match, without necessity of explicitly specifying them.
- `sd_redirect()` updated with a parameter called `newtab`, defaults to `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, the redirection link will be opened in a new tab. If used together with `delay`, the new tab might be blocked by the browser after count-down, but the user click will not be blocked.
- Improved the `database_uploading()` function to secure it from possible SQL injection attacks.

# surveydown 0.2.3

- Solved the speed problem for database connections: refactored `sd_server()` for efficiency; converted local data storage to lists instead of data frames.
- Assigned `session_id` as the leading column, and removed the `respondent_id` column.

# surveydown 0.2.2

- `sd_redirect()` to create redirection to external links, either by providing a button, a countdown, or both. This function can be called both in the survey body and the server chunk.
- `sd_get_url_pars()` to reactively get the parameters in the URL.
- The above 3 functions work together to retrieve and redirect URL parameters so that surveydown is compatible with survey panels.
- Now `sd_next()` and `sd_redirect()` both support the "Enter" key for a better user experience.
- Add automatic clean up in `sd_database()`.
- `sd_output()` function that replaces the original `sd_display_question()` (by specifying `type = "question"`) and `sd_display_value()` (by specifying `type = "value"`). The original 2 functions are depreciated and will be removed in future updates. If `sd_output()` is only used with `"id"` specified, it works the same as `shiny::uiOutput()`.

# surveydown 0.2.1

- In `sd_database()`, now `db_name` is changed to `dbname`, and `table_name` is changed to `table`, for consistency with Supabase, and simplicity of parameter names.
- Now the error message of `sd_database()` will also prompt "If you have verified all connection details are correct but still cannot access the database, consider setting the `gssencmode` parameter to `"disable"` in the `sd_database()` function." We don't encourage users to disable `gssencmode`, since it's more secure to have it on, but if users encounter with connection error, this will be a possible solution.
- Bug fix: A bug was introduced when restructuring the `sd_server()` function in the last update that affected numeric questions being determined as answered or not, that is now fixed.
- Fixed [issue #80](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown/issues/80): If `sd_display_value()` was used multiple times on different question IDs, it could only fetch the last user input. Now it's fixed.
- Renamed main lua file in `inst/quarto/filters` from `surveydown.lua` to `sd_main.lua` and updated the extension v0.2.5 to call this via a more robust, cross-platform approach.
- (Extension) Renamed the extension lua filter to `sd_wrapper.lua` to avoid naming conflict. Now the extension is only used as a wrapper. The `sd_main.lua` and related CSS and JS files are all in the R package.

# surveydown 0.2.0

- Moved `sd_store_value()` and `sd_copy_value()` to the server.R file (these are server operations).
- Added `respondent_id` variable that tracks the respondent based on their starting the survey.
- Restructure the server to be more efficient.
- Now the required questions can successfully bypass the hidden required questions of all types.

# surveydown 0.1.2

- Moved the main surveydown.lua file into the package at inst/quarto/filters. The surveydown Quarto extension is now just a wrapper to load this file, so the extension won't likely need to update any further as all updates can be made in the package lua file.
- Changed `jhelvy` to `surveydown-dev` in version control functions.
- Now if there are duplicated `page_id` and `question_id`, the survey will stop and show error.
- Removed roxygen2 documentation from non-exported functions.

# surveydown 0.1.1

- Added `sd_get_data()` with a `reactive` argument to enable reactive data fetching.
- `sd_question()` now has a `reactive` argument to enable reactive questions, and `sd_question_reactive()` was removed.
- Made `sd_admin_enable()` internal, changed to `admin_enable()`.
- Removed `sd_admin_ui()` and `sd_add_admin()` from the package.
- Moved the surveydown.css and page_nav.js files into the R package and out of the Quarto extension.
- Added keep alive functionality to the survey.
- Bug fixes: 
  - The admin page password was looking for the `SUPABASE_PASSWORD` environment variable, but it should be `SURVEYDOWN_PASSWORD`.
  - The data fetching was not working to download the data as a CSV file in the admin page, now uses `sd_get_data()` and works.
  - The `show_if_custom` logic was not working for multiple conditions, now it does.
  - The `skip_if_custom` logic could error if a condition was `NULL` (fixed with `isTRUE()`).
  - In `sd_config()`, items were being assigned with the ` <- ` operator, causing them to be deleted when the thing being assigned was `NULL`. Now changed to ` = `.

# surveydown 0.1.0

- Added `sd_display_value()` for displaying a question value based on the question `id`.
- Added `sd_copy_value()` for making a copy of a question value, which may be needed if you need to display something more than once since you can't make more than one object with the same `id`.
- Changed `sd_reactive_output()` to `sd_display_question()`.
- Changed how `sd_store_value()` works to avoid a global environment, and changed the arg name from `name` to `id`.
- Added `sd_add_admin()` function to react to admin_page condition, if set to true an 'Admin' page will be created for survey creators.
- Added `sd_admin_ui()` function to create the UI for the Admin page button.
- (extension) JS files removed from extension to R package. Now the extension only contains the `.lua` file and the css styles.

# surveydown 0.0.9

- Required questions are now moved to `sd_config()` as a separate `required_questions` argument, instead of being defined in `sd_question()`.
- Two new functions for supporting reactive questions: `sd_question_reactive()` and `sd_reactive_output()`.
- `sd_store_value()` function to store variables into the database. For example, `sd_store_value(respondentID, "respID")` will store the value of `respondentID` into a column named `"respID"`. If the name is not provided, the column will be named as its original variable name, in this case, `respondentID`.
- Enhanced robustness for progress bar. Now the progress bar will update based on user's input.
- Added a `timestamp` column in the beginning of the result dataframe.
- Now both Mac and PC will have no problem connecting with supabase.
- Updated all roxygen2 documentation texts.

# surveydown 0.0.8

- `sd_database()` function added with `pause` argument default to `FALSE`. If `pause = FALSE`, database will be properly connected; if `pause = TRUE`, a local CSV will be generated and survey results will be stored there.
- `sd_config()` function has `preview` removed due to `pause` in `sd_database`.
- For `pause = FALSE` (aka default), warning messages will be shown for missing or incorrect password, and will prompt the usage of `sd_set_password()`.
- Initiation of the `admin_page` argument in `config.R`.

# surveydown 0.0.7

- `sd_set_password()` function to set the supabase password as the survey environment variable. This function takes in a string, which should be your supabase password. We recommend you to only run it in the R Console so that your password does not appear in the `.qmd` file.
- (Continue) Upon running `sd_set_password()`, an `.Renviron` file will be created in your survey project root directory. In this file, `SUPABASE_PASSWORD=your_password` will be created, with `your_password` being whatever your input of `sd_set_password()`. Then, `.Renviron` will be added to your `.gitignore` file to avoid being pushed to GitHub.
- (Continue) If there is already an `.Renviron` file, `SUPABASE_PASSWORD=your_password` will be concatenated to the end. If there is already a definition of `SUPABASE_PASSWORD`, it will be overwritten. If there is no `.gitignore` file, it will be created. If there is already an `.Renviron` in `.gitignore`, it won't be duplicated.
- (Continue) All the above explanation means that you simply run `sd_set_password()` once to define supabase password for your survey project. It takes care of the rest of necessary operations, and you can rerun `sd_set_password()` to change the password, with the previous value safely overwritten.

# surveydown 0.0.6

- In `sd_database`, a `gssencmode` argument is added and set to "prefer" by default. In some cases, local deployment may fail due to network environments such as VPN settings. It can be solved by setting `gssencmode = "disable"` in the survey `qmd` file.
- Now the survey can be updated even AFTER its deployment. You may add, delete, or modify a question. The old question column and its time stamp, will stay where they were. The new question column and time stamp will be concatenated in the end of the table.
- (extension) Now the `example.qmd` survey has instructions for supabase configuration and shinyapps deployment.
- (extension) Now the `.gitignore` file has `.Renviron` included. This file will store supabase password and is essential for shinyapps deployment. Eliminating this file from pushing to GitHub will ensure that your password is only saved locally.


# surveydown 0.0.5

- `create_survey()` changed to `sd_create_survey()` for function name consistency.
- `sd_update_extension()` function to update the surveydown Quarto extension.
- `sd_check_versions()` function to check the version of both the R package and the Quarto extension. If any of them don't match with the latest version, there will be a suggestion to run the `sd_update_surveydown()` function.
- `sd_update_surveydown()` function to update both the R package and the Quarto extension.

# surveydown 0.0.4

- (extension) [Raleway Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) is set as the default font of the survey pages. Can be overwritten in the YAML header with the `theme` command using the [bootswatch themes](https://bootswatch.com) or a custom `scss` file.
- (extension) Default page background is set as "#f2f6f9" (a light blue color). Can be overwritten in the YAML header with the `backgroundcolor`.
- (extension) Questions are now encapsulated in a container that distinguishes from the descriptive texts.
- (extension) Options of `mc_button` and `mu_multiple_buttons` types of questions are now centered.
- Now the `surveydown::create_survey()` function will download the whole extension repo, containing the extension, an example survey, and an RStudio project.


# surveydown 0.0.3

- Now `show_if` can be applied to multiple options of the same question, which allows users to have more than one option in a question that triggers the revealing of a hidden question.
- Now if the "required" question is hidden, it will not trigger the page warning of "not all questions are answered".
- (extension) Now users can have a page with the same name of its ID and its header, regardless of capitalization. For example, users can now have a page ID being "#educational", and its header being "#Educational". This sounds as it should be, but in previous versions, the page hiding logic will show bug if page ID is the same as page header.

# surveydown 0.0.2

- Support added for the `required` argument in `sd_question()`, which allows users to force a question to be required. If not answered, a popup window blocks the user from continuing to the next page.
- The supabase backend is now connected and documentation on how to set up the database is complete.
- Initial setup for tests added

# surveydown 0.0.1

Initial version!
