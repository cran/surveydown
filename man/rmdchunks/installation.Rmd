### Install R & Quarto

- [R](https://CRAN.R-project.org/)
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

We also recommend working with an IDE that has good support for R, Quarto, and Shiny. [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is great, and we also like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron).

### Install the {surveydown} R package

You can install {surveydown} from CRAN in your R console:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("surveydown")
```

or you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown):

```{r}
#| eval: false

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak('surveydown-dev/surveydown')
```

Load the package with:

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(surveydown)
```

You can also check which version you have installed:

```{r}
#| eval: false

surveydown::sd_version()
```
